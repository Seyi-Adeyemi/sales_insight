# Sales & Customer Insights Project

## Executive Summary
This project analysed sales, customer behavior, product returns, shipping fees, and product performance. Using data-driven insights, the analysis identified key drivers of revenue, returns, and customer engagement, enabling actionable recommendations to improve business performance and operational efficiency.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales, returns, shipping, and customer behavior to provide actionable business recommendations.

## Key Questions
- Total Revenue: How much revenue did we generate in total, and how has revenue changed month-to-month?
- Top products by revenue and by units sold: Which products generate the most revenue, and which sell the most units?
- Returns by region: Which regions have the highest return rates and what is the financial impact of those returns?
- Average spending / Average Order Value (AOV): What is the average order value and how does it vary by region and gender?
- Age group trends — revenue, orders, AOV, and return behavior: How do different age groups behave (orders, revenue, AOV, returns)?
- Top customers (lifetime value / repeat purchase): Who are the top customers by lifetime revenue and how many repeat purchases do they make?
- Product return hotspots (products with high return rates): Which products have unusually high return rates and deserve investigation?
- Shipping fee impact on returns (correlation check): Do orders with higher/lower shipping fees have different return rates?
